# graph4lg

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

## Overview

The goal of `graph4lg` is to make easier the construction and analysis
of genetic and landscape graphs in landscape genetics studies (hence the
name `graph4lg`). The package allows to weight the links and to prune
the graphs by several ways. To our knowledge, it is the first software
which enables to create genetic graphs with such a large variety of
parameters. Besides, it allows to carry out preliminary analyses of the
spatial pattern of genetic differentiation in order to choose the best
genetic distance and pruning method in every context. Lastly, it makes
possible the comparison of two spatial graphs sharing the same nodes.

## Installation

You can install the released version of graph4lg from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("graph4lg")
```

## Example

The package includes a tutorial with examples showing why and how to use
each of the included functions. The package also includes data sets in
order to test the functions.

More complete tutorials in English or French language are available for
more details.
