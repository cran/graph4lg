\description{
Genetic dataset from genetic simulation on CDPOP
200 individuals, 10 populations
20 microsatellite loci (3 digits coding)
100 generations simulated
}
\details{
The simulation was made with CDPOP during 100 generations.
Dispersal was possible between the 10 populations. Its probability depended
on the cost distance between populations, calculated on a simulated
resistance surface (raster). Mutations were not possible. There
were initially 600 alleles in total (many disappeared because of drift).
Population stayed constant
with a sex-ratio of 1. Generations did not overlap.
This simulation includes a part of stochasticity and these data result
from only 1 simulation run.
